                We are currently working with our lawyers to draft something that represents us, as well as you (our beloved user). <br></br>

                You can be certain that at the end of the day, our Terms of Use will be reasonable and fair to all parties involved. <br></br>

                In the mean time, we urge you to use our services in such a  way that makes the web a better place. <br></br>
                
                Thanks
